### Hi! :wave:

I'm Stephen (He/Him)

There's [a website](https://sirosen.net) where I write things down sometimes,
like my intro to `awk`,
[Demystifying Magical Robot Farts](https://sirosen.net/2021/09/05/magical-robot-farts.html).

### Creations :tada:

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/sirosen/dotfiles) repo has lots of interesting and handy tidbits,
like my hex-to-ANSI converter.

I'm the primary author and maintainer of a few tools:

- [check-jsonschema](https://github.com/sirosen/check-jsonschema) is a CLI
  for `jsonschema`.
  It doubles as a [pre-commit](pre-commit.com) hook with integrations with
  SchemaStore.

- [click-type-test](https://github.com/sirosen/click-type-test) is a tool for
  testing CLIs built with [click](https://github.com/pallets/click). It helps
  you check that your annotations match your `click` arguments and options.

- [dependency-groups](https://github.com/sirosen/dependency-groups) is an
  implementation of
  [PEP 735 - Dependency Groups](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/).

- [flake8-typing-as-t](https://github.com/sirosen/flake8-typing-as-t) is a
  [flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8) plugin which insists that you use
  `import typing as t` style in Python.

- [mddj](https://github.com/sirosen/mddj) is a utility for inspecting Python
  package metadata from the CLI. I use it to help keep my lower-bounds in sync
  between CI and `Python-Requires`.

- [slyp](https://github.com/sirosen/slyp) is an opinionated linter and
  autofixer for Python, based on my own style preferences and those of folks I
  work with.

- [texthooks](https://github.com/sirosen/texthooks) is a set of
  [pre-commit](pre-commit.com) hooks for checking any text files.
  Folks especially seem to like `alphabetize-codeowners`!

- [upadup](https://github.com/sirosen/upadup) is a neat little tool for
  updating the pinned `additional_dependencies` of your
  [pre-commit](pre-commit.com) hooks.

#### Archived Creations

I no longer maintain these, but maybe they'll still inspire you!

- [ce2](https://github.com/sirosen/ce2) is an AWS CostExplorer explorer.

- [git-fortune](https://github.com/sirosen/git-fortune) is a `fortune` clone,
  but for `git` tips!

- [OpenResume](https://github.com/sirosen/OpenResume) is a project for
  generating a beautiful PDF and HTML resume from a single source of truth.

- [paramiko-shell](https://github.com/sirosen/paramiko-shell) is a remote shell
  tool built within [paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko).

- [tinyprompt](https://github.com/sirosen/tinyprompt) is a Python library for
  writing operational scripts with a `yes / skip / abort` paradigm.

- [vim-rockstar](https://github.com/sirosen/vim-rockstar) is a filetype plugin
  for the goofy, esoteric
  [Rockstar](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar) language.

### Notable Contributions

I'm one of the maintainers of [webargs](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/webargs)

I'm the current maintainer of [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2).
(But I don't get much time for it these days.)

I also contribute to other projects like
[marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) and
[SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore) as I'm able.

### Globus projects

I work at [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), a divison of the University of Chicago.

At Globus, I have been one of the primary authors of

- [The Globus Python SDK](https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python)
- [The Globus CLI](https://github.com/globus/globus-cli)

among other various projects.
